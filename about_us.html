								<p><span class="image left", STYLE="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(46, 56, 66); font-size: 30pt">It all started <br /> as a dream</span>It all started as a dream of two individuals who transferred to Penn State Harrisburg. Athreya Nagesh and Rohan Gaglani brought their Formula SAE experiences from their previous college and decided to start a Formula SAE team at Penn State Harrisburg. The Society of Automotive Engineers(SAE) Club was already existing on campus under the leadership of Seth Fisher. The club mainly emphasized on the the Baja Competition rather than the Formula competition. The 2015 Baja Team took up the Baja car as their capstone project and participated in the Baja SAE competition at Auburn, Alabama. </p>
								<p>In May 2015, Rohan and Athreya took over the SAE club as President and Vice-President to start and establish the Formula SAE team at Penn State Harrisburg. This is when the Formula dream began for the Penn State Harrisburg campus, a dream to built a racecar, a dream to get Penn State Harrisburg on the map of engineering schools with Formula SAE teams, a dream to compete with some of the elite colleges in the field of engineering; and it wasnâ€™t going to be easy.</p>
								<p>The initial stages of team formation were spent advertising the club and letting the students on campus know that a team was actually planning to build a racecar on campus, a real racecar that would be driven by the members of the team! Apart from the idea being fun and exciting, it was a brilliant opportunity to get hands on experience in the engineering field. Formula SAE competitions are highly regarded in industry, companies like GM, Ford and Chrysler are present at the Formula SAE events held around the world. There as a good response where about 30-40 people showed up for the first information session of the club. This is when the team met Nathan Golshan, a transfer student from Stanford University who had previously worked on the solar car project there. He was extremely interested in the project and would later go on to take the position of Lead Engineer for the 2015-2016 academic year. He got many college seniors involved and pushed them to take the project up as a senior capstone project. The team had officially started. It was also going to influence the lives of many people on the Penn State Harrisburg campus.</p>
								<p>In fall of 2015 we got our first funding from the Student Activities Fee(SAF) at Penn State Harrisburg towards the car. Over the year, we received many sponsorships from different companies. As it appears, SAF will continue to sponsor the project for Spring 2016 and Fall 2016 too. The capstone teams did a very good job and set the Formula SAE team on track to participate in the Formula SAE competition at Michigan in 2017. Nathan Golshan would graduate in fall 2016 and go on to become a part of Google, working on their self driving car project.</p>
								<p>The Formula SAE team at Penn State Harrisburg today is very well established and is gearing to participate in the competition at Michigan in 2017. The team comprises of 57 members,27 of whom are going to the 2017 competition while the rest will be designing their own car to take part in the 2018 competition. The team members possess the motivation passion and commitment to do whatever it takes to present a winning car at the competition, how much ever far fetched the idea may seem. </p>
